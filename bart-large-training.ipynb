       "      <td>A group of Brazilian convicts who tunnelled out of jail to freedom filmed the whole escape on a mobile phone ... before posting the videos online to taunt their hoodwinked guards. In a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, 13 prisoners dug a small hole under the wall between their cell and the prison yard in Rio Verde, Goias State, before darting to freedom under cover of darkness. But unlike the famous movie, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, which is set in the 1940s, their escape had very modern twist. Rather than focus purely on getting out of jail without detection, they felt compelled to record the whole experience on a mobile phone and post it on the internet for all to see. Scroll down for video . Brazen: The thirteen prisoners filmed their escape on mobile phones, laughing as they did so, before later posting the video online . Like a movie: In a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, the prisoners dug a small hole under the wall that separated their cell and the prison yard in Rio Verde, Goias State, before darting to freedom under cover of darkness . Police deputy Jacqueline Camargo Machado admitted that the prisoners' cells had not been inspected for two months, blaming staff shortages. She said: 'The guard that was there on the day was looking after other things most of the time. 'We now know that there had not been an inspection of the cell for almost 60 days. They were able to dig a tunnel and it was easy to escape after that.' Ezequias Gonçalves Miranda and William Pereira Da Mata were two of the crooks that tunnelled out of jail to freedom. It is unclear if they appeared in the video . More than Freeman: It was a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, starring Morgan Freeman (left) and Tim Robbins (right) - but with a very modern twist . The prison guard on duty has been suspended for not managing to foil the secret plot. A manhunt has been launched resulting in the capture of two men. The other 11 remain at large. It is not the first escape from Brazilian jail. A year ago 54 prisoners staged a mass escape after a riot at the Fundação Casa youth detentionfacility in Sao Paulo, which houses more than 100 detainees. Dozens of the under-age offenders set fire to their mattresses, sparking a blaze in the prison's central yard.  Helicopter images showed plumes of smoke rising from the detention centre. Video footage also showed prisoners climbing over the prison walls and escaping down trees. Nearly 30 staff members were held hostage during the riot and the facility's director was admitted to hospital with cuts to his head and bruised ribs.</td>\n",

       "0  A group of Brazilian convicts who tunnelled out of jail to freedom filmed the whole escape on a mobile phone ... before posting the videos online to taunt their hoodwinked guards. In a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, 13 prisoners dug a small hole under the wall between their cell and the prison yard in Rio Verde, Goias State, before darting to freedom under cover of darkness. But unlike the famous movie, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, which is set in the 1940s, their escape had very modern twist. Rather than focus purely on getting out of jail without detection, they felt compelled to record the whole experience on a mobile phone and post it on the internet for all to see. Scroll down for video . Brazen: The thirteen prisoners filmed their escape on mobile phones, laughing as they did so, before later posting the video online . Like a movie: In a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, the prisoners dug a small hole under the wall that separated their cell and the prison yard in Rio Verde, Goias State, before darting to freedom under cover of darkness . Police deputy Jacqueline Camargo Machado admitted that the prisoners' cells had not been inspected for two months, blaming staff shortages. She said: 'The guard that was there on the day was looking after other things most of the time. 'We now know that there had not been an inspection of the cell for almost 60 days. They were able to dig a tunnel and it was easy to escape after that.' Ezequias Gonçalves Miranda and William Pereira Da Mata were two of the crooks that tunnelled out of jail to freedom. It is unclear if they appeared in the video . More than Freeman: It was a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, starring Morgan Freeman (left) and Tim Robbins (right) - but with a very modern twist . The prison guard on duty has been suspended for not managing to foil the secret plot. A manhunt has been launched resulting in the capture of two men. The other 11 remain at large. It is not the first escape from Brazilian jail. A year ago 54 prisoners staged a mass escape after a riot at the Fundação Casa youth detentionfacility in Sao Paulo, which houses more than 100 detainees. Dozens of the under-age offenders set fire to their mattresses, sparking a blaze in the prison's central yard.  Helicopter images showed plumes of smoke rising from the detention centre. Video footage also showed prisoners climbing over the prison walls and escaping down trees. Nearly 30 staff members were held hostage during the riot and the facility's director was admitted to hospital with cuts to his head and bruised ribs.   \n",
