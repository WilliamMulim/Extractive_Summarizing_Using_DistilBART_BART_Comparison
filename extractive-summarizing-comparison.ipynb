      "Don't be fooled, Arsene. Don’t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year. It is not uncommon to see Arsenal finish a season with a string of good results. Usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the Barclays Premier League. The same thing has happened this year. Chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before Christmas. Arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals last week . Alexis Sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for Arsenal at Wembley . With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won’t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won’t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could ‘smell’ something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal’s board don’t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn’t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid’s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal’s money like it’s his own, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be stressed, are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season, when they only just held off Everton’s challenge to finish fourth. But there is still room for improvement. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at Wembley last Saturday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on Friday . Results have been impressive since David Ospina replaced Wojciech Szczesny, who had failed to show the required consistency. Ospina has played 12 Premier League games; Arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets, but Wenger still needs to buy a new No 1 if they are to be title challengers. Petr Cech would be an ideal candidate to come in. Laurent Koscielny has steadied things in defence, with Arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he’s played since January 1 but, to progress, Wenger needs another top centre back. Gabriel Paulista arrived in the New Year but it seems it was to provide cover for Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Francis Coquelin has added bite to the midfield, but would Arsenal have enough to challenge next season if Coquelin is their anchor and Mikel Arteta is his back up? No. Why doesn’t he go for Paul Pogba, who looks set to leave Juventus? Wenger spent £42m on Mesut Ozil, so why not spend the same and more on Pogba. If they needed to sign Ozil two years ago, their need to sign Pogba this summer is even greater. Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is 29 and at the peak of his powers. He would be ideal at the heart of the defence. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina pictured during a training session at London Colney last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech warms up before Saturday's Premier League clash against Manchester United . Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, has provided a focal point up front. I like Giroud. He is an under-rated striker and, had he not missed three months with a broken ankle, his tally would be more than 14; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes, the second best rate in the Premier League. Giroud is one of a number of good options Wenger has up front. Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant, while Danny Welbeck has played his part, but that should not stop Wenger looking to improve on what he has got. If a forward with the class of players he has had before, such as Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka, comes on the market, Wenger would have to move for him. Imagine what Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero or Karim Benzema could do for Arsenal? I’m not saying Arsenal are getting to the levels of ‘The Invincibles’ but their form has me thinking they are getting closer. The 2-0 win at Manchester City in January could be a turning point. They made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open. Hopefully we will see more of this. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at Wembley . Danny Welbeck (left) looks to evade the challenge of Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu (centre) and Alex Pearce . Of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago, and Wenger has not had a smooth ride. Fans turned on him after they lost at Stoke — and after the Champions League defeat to Monaco — leading to talk about Jurgen Klopp coming in. But some perspective is needed. Wenger has done a good job keeping Arsenal consistently in the top four — all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between — and by the end of next month, they could have won back-to-back FA Cups. How could you then get rid of Wenger? So one question would need asking: what are they waiting for? Both Manchester clubs will spend in the summer, but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix. City’s squad is old and needs big investment, while United will have the complication of being back in Europe. Wenger, then, could use the next window to call it on. The message it would send out to his players, fans and, most significantly, their rivals would be huge. It would let everyone know they were launching an all-out assault on the title. They would have to be taken seriously. Beating Chelsea on Sunday won’t alter things in the short term, but it will offer belief that Arsenal can challenge next season. What they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make. Finding some special players could transform them. Borussia Dortmund head coach Jurgen Klopp celebrates after beating SC Paderborn last weekend . Wenger applauds the Arsenal fans after his side booked their place in the FA Cup final . Big guns missed out on a Fab freebie . Full marks to Aston Villa. They are a side rejuvenated by Tim Sherwood and absolutely deserved to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Jack Grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role Fabian Delph played was just as important; his aggression, energy and left foot gives Villa balance in their midfield. Liverpool couldn’t cope with his aggression. Earlier this season, Delph was lauded for committing his future to Villa even when their position in the Barclays Premier League was threatened. He signed a four-year deal, which showed his character could never be called into question. What can be called into question, however, is the wisdom of some other clubs in the Premier League. Fabian Delph (right) celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against Liverpool in the FA Cup semis . Delph, do not forget, was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young England international for free. No doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder, to go with the ones they signed last summer, and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we don’t have enough English players playing for top sides competing in Europe. There will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy English players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings. The Delph situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense. He is now Villa’s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months. His progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the England squad and if he can add more goals to his game — like the one he scored against Liverpool — he could reach a very high level. Delph slots the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Villa's 2-1 victory at Wembley . If Delph does maintain his improvement, inevitably clubs will come looking at him. But if they want him, it will cost. For reasons only they know, they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing. Their loss is most certainly Villa’s gain.\n",

      "It has long been a complaint that all politicians are the same. Now the Green party has set it to music, with a new election advert featuring David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage forming a bizarre pro-austerity boyband. The video, complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change, is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration. The video begins with 'David Cameron' playing a white grand piano, with 'Ed Miliband' looking on . It sees Mr Cameron entering a polling booth and telling voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys' The advert is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration . The song, Change The Tune, features comedians playing the four party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition. According to the Green party, the quartet 'sing in harmony about their shared love of austerity and fondness for fracking'. It sees Mr Cameron tell voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys'. The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition.' It also takes a swipe at the background of leading politicians, with the verse: 'The choice between us couldn't be clearer, Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya, Whether it's Trident or High Speed Two, The lesser of four evils is up to you.' Notably the video, which last 3minutes, 40 seconds, does not feature Green leader Natalie Bennett at all. With the party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition, the video is complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change . Dancing around a large pound sign, the four leaders are shown singing: 'Austerity! Austerity! Austerity!' Green party leader Natatlie Bennett said she wanted to show how the Establishment parties 'have been singing from the same hymn sheet' The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition' She has suffered a series of difficult media appearances in recent weeks, including claiming people who join ISIS should not be criminalised, struggling to make her housing sums add up and admitting it could take decades to implement her 'citizen's income'. Despite the gaffes, the Green party has enjoyed a sharp rise in popularity in the last year and now boasts more members than both the Lib Dems and Ukip. Unveiling the new advert, Ms Bennett said: 'For many years the Establishment parties have been singing from the same hymn sheet. 'The Westminster consensus – which sees all other parties sign up to austerity economics, privatisation of our public services and inaction on climate change – is coming to an end. The Green Party is offering a real alternative to business-as-usual politics. 'We want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means bringing in a Living Wage of £10 an hour by 2020 and fair taxes on rich individuals and Britain's biggest corporations. 'Voting Green on May 7th is a chance for people to play their part in breaking open the political harmony of the Establishment parties.'\n",

Goannas, which come from the monitor lizard family, are found throughout most of Australia, but it’s unknown where the clip was filmed.

Right-back Javi Manquillo is set to return to Spain after failing to make an impact while Mario Balotelli’s £16million switch from AC Milan has been a disaster. Liverpool will listen to offers for him, although getting rid of a man on £90,000 per week will be easier said than done. Balotelli’s fellow strikers Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert could also depart. Finally, Liverpool are looking for a goalkeeper to replace or put pressure on Simon Mignolet, meaning Brad Jones is the tenth name who would be surplus to requirements. There was one good piece of news for Liverpool fans on Monday night when Jordan Henderson agreed a new £100,000-a-week deal until 2020. Henderson, 24, is the third player in the squad to agree a contract extension, following Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho.

      "Inverness Cup hero Gary Warren has called for a change to the 'ridiculous' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons. Warren picked up his second booking of the competition in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final win over Celtic – meaning automatic suspension for the season finale on May 30. But the central defender, who also missed last year's League Cup Final for the same reason, says either the threshold should be raised – or all cards should be wiped from the record for any show-piece final. Inverness defender Gary Warren will miss the Scottish Cup final after picking up his second yellow card . Warren was shown a yellow card for this challenge on Celtic's James Forrest (right) during the semi-final . 'Having two bookings (as the limit) in a cup competition is ridiculous,' said Warren. 'Especially being a defender, it means you can't tackle - and that's part and parcel of being a defender, making challenges, making interceptions, making blocks. 'To have something like that taken away from you is a little bit gutting. I think it should be looked at. They should either increase the number of bookings needed to get a suspension - or, if you get to the final, wipe it out completely. 'Then it's fair for everyone, every team that gets to the semi-final, whoever is booked knows it's a clean slate for the final.' Warren knew instantly that he'd miss the final when ref Steven McLean rightly showed him a yellow card for hauling back James Forrest. More annoying for the 30-year-old is that his previous booking in the competition came for dissent, as he explaining: 'That was my own fault gobbing off to a referee. That's disappointing because I should have kept my mouth shut. It was against Partick Thistle, that's me getting frustrated and being too gobby to the referee. 'That hurts the most because this one was a tackle and a foul but the first one was a very silly booking. I'm 30 years old and I should know better. 'When you come into this game you always think about it and wonder what if - but if you start allowing it to play on your mind then you're going to pull out of tackles. I won't do that. Warren feels that the rule to have players suspended for amassing just two yellows is 'ridiculous' Celtic's Adam Matthews (right) slides in with a challenge on Nick Ross (left) during the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'After missing last year's final, I'm gutted again. It's just lady luck. You take it on the chin and move on.' Warren says he will definitely not be doing a John Terry and turning up in full kit to take part in any celebrations should Caley Thistle beat Falkirk in the final, saying: 'No, that's not me at all, no chance. I'll be in the background somewhere, in the stands. 'I suppose you kind of feel not part of it in the final but I'll still have a few beers. For the size of Inverness, as a small club, to get to a final for a second successive year is an unbelievable achievement. 'Everything is in our hands. We've got to bring back silverware for the way we' ve worked in the last three seasons.' Inverness' Edward Ofere scores his side's second goal during the 3-2 win over Celtic on Sunday . Inverness players celebrate David Raven's (second from right) winning goal against Celtic on Sunday .\n",

'After I played 15 good games, I know that some clubs have followed me. It is too early to talk about that, but I want to stay in the Premier League.

      "Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United at Elland Road after the Welsh club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets. Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United . The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game . Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets . The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets . 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were . Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon . West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday . Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The \"bad old days\" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of \"fans\" have thankfully been left far behind us now. This is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit. Let’s hope that this message hits home loud and clear to Leeds United Football Club.'\n",

      "A Wyoming State Penitentiary inmate has pleaded guilty to trying — from behind bars — to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather so he could collect life insurance money and inherit their house. Andrew Silicani, 23, of Cheyenne pleaded guilty on Monday in federal court to four counts of using the mail in his unsuccessful plan to hire someone to carry out the murders. He faces up to 40 years at sentencing this summer. 'I think it's fair to say you'll be looking at some time in custody,' U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal told Silicani as she advised him of his rights. Andrew Silicani, 23, of Cheyenne, Wyoming, pleaded guilty on Monday to trying — from behind bars — to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather so he could inherit their house . Silicani pleaded guilty to all charges against him with no agreement from prosecutors to recommend a lesser sentence. Defense lawyer James Barrett told Freudenthal that Silicani had rejected a plea offer from federal prosecutors that would have capped his prison time at 35 years and blocked the possibility that state prosecutors will seek to charge him with separate violations of state law. Speaking after the hearing, Barrett said he thinks it's likely that Silicani will face additional state prosecution. Barrett said Silicani's decision to reject the federal plea offer reflected Silicani's view that a 35-year federal sentence would be excessive. Recounting his actions to support his guilty pleas, Silicani told Freudenthal, 'I used the mail, wrote four letters asking for this to be done — for the murders of my mom and stepdad. I understand what I've done. I felt that pleading guilty would be best.' Silicani told the judge he regarded his actions as 'a big error in judgment — I'd take it back if I could.' Silicani was serving a five- to seven-year sentence at the state prison in Rawlins for conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery resulting in bodily injury, according to the Department of Corrections. He was sentenced in April 2012. According to an FBI agent's statement filed in court, a confidential source contacted prison staff in November and reported that Silicani had asked if the source would be willing to kill Silicani's mother and stepfather. Investigators had the source direct Silicani to correspond with an FBI agent posing as a hit man. Silicani provided the supposed hit man with the names and address of his parents and said he didn't want to pay more than $100,000 for the 'demolition work.' Court records said Silicani expected to receive $850,000 in life insurance and property. The confidential source told law enforcement that Silicani was excited at the prospect of the murders and said he planned to buy, 'a Cadillac Escalade, clothes and jewelry.'\n",

      "A Wyoming State Penitentiary inmate has pleaded guilty to trying — from behind bars — to hire a hit man to kill his mother and stepfather so he could collect life insurance money and inherit their house. Defense lawyer James Barrett told Freudenthal that Silicani had rejected a plea offer from federal prosecutors that would have capped his prison time at 35 years and blocked the possibility that state prosecutors will seek to charge him with separate violations of state law. I felt that pleading guilty would be best.'

      "From underground bunkers and tactical bicycles to heavily armored vehicles, they were taught new ways to deal with a zombie apocalypse or a  natural disaster - and also met some TV stars. Hundreds of survivalists and so-called 'Preppers', of all ages and levels of 'experience', descended on the Salt Lake City, Utah, suburb of Sandy on Friday for the nation's first ever PrepperCon. During the two-day expo, they were shown specially-equipped underground bunkers, learned new methods of storing food, tried out solar powered flashlights - and even dressed up as zombies. They were also greeted by actors from the AMC hit show 'The Walking Dead', including Addy Miller, who took pictures with fans and acted as a judge in an emergency preparedness food cook-off. Scroll down for video . Motoped:  Hundreds of survivalists and so-called 'Preppers' descended on the Salt Lake City, Utah, suburb of Sandy on Friday for the first ever PrepperCon. Above, Ken Stone demonstrates the Motoped Survival Bike . Suitable for zombie hunting? The Motoped is described as a vehicle that can 'go where stand alone bicycles or motorcycles can't'. It has a 500-mile (805km) range, a 200 mpg  efficiency and a heavy-duty universal rack . Tactical weapons: Niel Burnett, of Covers & Camo, clutches a gun as he demonstrates 'Prepper and tactical seat covers' during PrepperCon, which also featured actors from the AMC hit show 'The Walking Dead' Dress-up: Attendees  learned new ways to store food, were led around underground bunkers, tried out solar powered flashlights - and even dressed up as zombies. Above, an image tweeted by PrepperCon organizers . Scott Stallings, one of PrepperCon's founders, said the event was inspired by ComicCon's success, adding that he had amped up the entertainment with the hope of attracting younger attendees. He said that Utah made sense for America's first expo because of the Mormon culture's emphasis on food storage and self-reliance. Among the expo's main events was a zombie costume contest. 'In the prepping industry, we look at zombies as a metaphor,' said Mr Stallings, who lives in Murray. 'Anyone that's coming to take away your stuff, your safety, inflict harm on your family.' Vendors who filled the South Towne Expo Center on Friday and Saturday showed off an array of gear to help people survive a zombie apocalypse, a natural disaster or life in the wilderness. This gear included knives of all shapes and sizes, hi-tech gadgets, food storage units, first aid supplies and armored trucks. There were also live demonstrations and the survival cooking contest. Motoped employee Ken Stone showed off the Motoped Survival Bike, described by the company as a 'tactical blank canvas' with a 500-mile range, 200mpg efficiency and a heavy-duty universal rack. Hideout: Scott Stallings, one of PrepperCon's founders, said he had amped up the entertainment with the hope of attracting younger attendees. Above, Mike Peters, with Ultimate Bunker, is pictured lying on a bunk in a 100 per cent steel underground bunker on the first day of the event at Utah's South Towne Expo Center . Bunker: Mr Stallings said that Utah made sense for the first expo because of the Mormon culture's emphasis on food storage and self-reliance. Above, Mr Peters stands in front of the impressive underground bunker . Armored: Robert and Dori Wickert look at a prototype combat vehicle during the PrepperCon expo on Friday . Demonstration: Sam Warren climbs into the vehicle as hundreds of survivalists and 'Preppers' eagerly watch . Contest: PrepperCon organizers took to Twitter to encourage attendees to dress up in their best zombie gear . The Motoped Survival Bike is described as something in between a 'hard-core downhill mountain bike and a fully-fledged motorcycle'. It can be pedaled or motored without stopping to make a change, and can 'go where stand alone bicycles or motorcycles can't'. Unit weight: 132 pounds . Range: 500 miles (805 km) Efficiency: 200 mpg (1.2 L/100km) Top speed: 24mph . Engine Displacement: 49cc / 125cc . Max Horsepower: 49cc - 2.41 HP @ 7500 RPM / 125cc - 7.78 @ 7500 RPM . Front Suspension: Adjustable DNM USD-8 Forks (8\" travel) Rear Suspension: Adjustable DNM Burner - RCP2 Shock . Seat Height: 35\" (Adjustable) Cost: $2,499 . Source: Motoped . The $2,500 bike can be pedaled or motored without stopping to make a change, and can 'go where stand alone bicycles or motorcycles can't'. But with a top speed of 24mph, could it outrun zombies? The company certainly appears to think so. 'This bike was built for the creative survivalist. Apply your favorite gear and escape with your life,' an online description of the vehicle reads. Following PrepperCon, Miller, 15, told KUTV that she thought the expo had been 'really cool' and that Salt Lake City was a 'gorgeous' region. 'I enjoy meeting the fans and getting their perspective on the show,' she added. The North Carolina teenager was joined at the event on Saturday by her co-star, Theo Crane. Celebrity survival expert Mykel Hawke, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer who is best known for his role on the reality TV series 'Man, Woman, Wild', also made an appearance. On its website, PrepperCon describes a 'Prepper' as 'a person who believes a major disaster or emergency is likely to occur in the future and makes active preparations for it.' Prepared: Beryl Paffrath, left, handles a Akdal 1919, AR-15 style, 12 gauge shotgun, while Matthew Kitterman, of MTK Arms, looks on during the expo. The two-day event was apparently inspired by ComicCon's success . Apocalypse: PrepperCon tweeted this screenshot from its event commercial, made by Centerstar Marketing . Actress: 'The Walking Dead' star Addy Miller took pictures with fans and acted as a judge in an emergency preparedness food cook-off. Above, the actress told KUTV that she thought the expo was 'really cool' Enthusiastic: Miller, 15, took to Twitter last week to promote her appearance at PrepperCon in Salt Lake City . They do so by 'stockpiling food, ammunition, and other supplies', it says. In relation to its two-day expo, it adds: 'We combine the best of entertainment, emergency preparedness, gun shows, off-grid living and survival into one incredible experience.' PrepperCon's motto is 'Prepare. Protect. Survive. Thrive.' A single day pass for the event was $14.00, while a two-day pass was priced at $25.00.\n",

      "Two children have been killed in what police are calling an accidental vehicle fire at a Las Vegas apartment complex. Investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan Saturday evening at the Arcadia Palms on East Sahara Avenue  when one of them unintentionally set a fire inside. Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!' Another resident told KLAS-TV that a woman, believed to be one of the boy's mother, was taken to hospital shortly after the incident and described hearing a huge explosion. They said authorities informed them the pair were related. Residents at the apartment complex say they heard a huge explosion followed by a massive plume of smoke .

      "Roberto Carlos has revealed his desire to one day become manager of Brazil and the former Real Madrid defender claims he finds coaching 'very easy' after the pressures he faced as a player. The 42-year-old, a World Cup winner in 2002, has already worked on the sidelines in Turkey with Sivasspor and  Akhisar Belediyespor. He guided Sivasspor to sixth place in the 2013-14 Turkish Super Lig but departed in December after a poor start the following year. Roberto Carlos claims to find coaching 'easy' and is targeting becoming the manager of Brazil . As a player with Brazil, Carlos (right) won the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea . Carlos (second left) celebrates winning the Champions League in 2000 by beating Valencia 3-0 in the final . Despite that, Carlos has not had his confidence shaken and aims to eventually lead Brazil. 'My objective is to coach the national team,' Carlos said to Folha de Sao Paulo. 'I know I have a long way to go yet and for that reason I won't put a timeframe on how long it will take. 'Everything I experienced in the national team was amazing. I was there for 14 years and won several titles: the Copa America, Confederations Cup and the World Cup.' Carlos added that he learnt something from all the managers he worked under as a player, including the current England boss Roy Hodgson at Inter Milan, and thinks it could be why he finds coaching straightforward. Carlos (right) added that he has learnt a lot from the managers he worked for as a player . Carlos played for a number of top coaches, such as England managers  Fabio Capello (left) and Roy Hodgson . 'It's very easy,' he explained. 'I was well prepared by playing football and living under pressure. I spent my career at big clubs.

Stefan Stoykov, a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, moved to the US from Bulgaria as an eight-year-old when he could not speak a word of English. Now 18, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools on the planet – and admits he can hardly believe it. Scroll down for video . Top of the class: Stefan Stoykov has been accepted in to all eight Ivy League schools – and a further ten big league universities . Stefan told WTHR: 'It is an incredible feeling. I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Yale and Princeton have all come knocking. He had only held out hopes of hearing from one of them but has also heard from 10 other prestigious institutions. The teen, who could not speak English when he joined the second grade at Nora Elementary school in Washington Township, has yet to make a decision. He revealed that hard work and the support of his parents had helped him achieve his goals. He added that the hard work of his mother, a housekeeper, had inspired him over the years . 'I still can't get over the fact all these schools accepted me,' he told WTHR. 'I can't describe it. I am still having trouble believing it.

And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include helping to tutor other students while he is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score. He is not the first teenager to be accepted into all eight Ivy League schools. Just days ago it was revealed how North Carolina student Victor Agbafe had done the same. The 17-year-old, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, was accepted into 14 schools in all including Stanford and Duke. Another high school student, Harold Ekeh of Long Island, was also accepted into all eight Ivy League schools. Ekeh, 18, was editor of his student paper and CEO of the Model UN. He  moved from Nigeria to Long Island at the age of eight, got a 2270 on his SATs and also has plans to be a neurosurgeon so he can find an Alzheimer's cure for his grandmother.

      "Morgan Schneiderlin says Southampton are refusing to give up on their Champions League aspirations despite Saturday's damaging defeat at Stoke. Saints missed the chance to close the gap on fourth-placed Manchester City to two points as they went down to a 2-1 defeat at the Britannia Stadium. Schneiderlin opened the scoring with his first Barclays Premier League goal since September, but a mistake from Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis allowed Mame Diouf to equalise and substitute Charlie Adam stole all three points with six minutes to go. Morgan Schneiderlin fires Southampton into the lead at the Britannia with a close-range finish . Schneiderlin accepts the Europa League is a more realistic goal for Southampton now, but he insists the players still have faint hopes of qualifying for the premier club competition in Europe. 'We wanted to achieve the top four and now it's going to be even more complicated but we're not going to give up,' the midfielder told Southampton's website. 'We wanted to give the fans the most prestigious competition but if not, we want to give them the Europa League. We want to secure European football for this club, that's our main target.' Stoke had struggled to create any decent chances before Davis' misjudgement handed them a way back into the game less than two minutes into the second half. The 38-year-old declined to catch Steven Nzonzi's shot, believing it was going wide. The ball struck the angle and the goalkeeper had no time to respond before Diouf swept in from eight yards. Schneiderlin (left) makes a run as Stoke's Steven Nzonzi gives chase on Saturday . Saints manager Ronald Koeman was loathe to criticise his goalkeeper after the match. 'I call it unlucky,' the Dutchman said. 'I will have to watch it back. I don't know if it was a cross or a shot, and maybe the wind was part of the difficulty for Kelvin.' Saints' demise was complete when substitute Adam nipped the ball away from Sadio Mane in the box and swept a volley past Davis. Mame Biram Diouf swept in from 10 yards as Stoke forced an equaliser in the 47th minute . After scoring a 65-yard wonder goal against Chelsea just a couple of weeks ago, Adam was unhappy at starting the game on the bench, but he thinks he gave his manager the perfect response. 'It's nice to keep scoring and win the game,' the Scot said. 'It was disappointing to be on the bench and I think it was a great way to react by not starting the game.' The win moved Stoke to within four points of their 50-point target for the season. Charlie Adam secured all three points for Stoke as the hit the winner with six minutes remaining . And Adam believes the Potters can make up the one-point gap that separates them from eighth-placed Swansea. He said: 'We're edging nearer to doing better than last season and since the manager came in, our aim is to keep improving year upon year. 'We are a top-10 club and we want to consolidate ourselves in that position, so we want to keep pushing on for the remaining games of the season. 'It will be difficult, but we will keep pushing on and if we can finish in eighth place then we will be very happy.' Ronald Koeman applauds the Saints fans as their dreams of Champions League qualification all but ended .\n",

Schneiderlin opened the scoring with his first Barclays Premier League goal since September, but a mistake from Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis allowed Mame Diouf to equalise and substitute Charlie Adam stole all three points with six minutes to go. We wanted to achieve the top four and now it's going to be even more complicated but we're not going to give up,' the midfielder told Southampton's website. '\n",

      "An experiment on the ISS will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity. In the weightless environment of the space station, researchers will monitor how plants grow in a particular direction without a noticeable gravitational pull. The results could help farmers on Earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond Earth orbit to the moon and Mars. An experiment on the ISS will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity. Nasa astronaut Karen Nyberg is pictured harvesting plants from a previous Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) investigation of thale cress during Expedition 37 in 2013 . The experiment is being run by researchers at the Japanese space agency (Jaxa). German researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system, which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser. They hope to build a greenhouse in Antarctica to test the first space garden in 2016. The system is being developed at the German Aerospace Center in Bremen, and is called Eden (Evolution and Design of Environmentally-closed Nutrition sources). Funded by Esa, the greenhouses will contain combined life-support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser, helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and Mars environment. Scientists from Virginia are also hoping to use meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes. If the study proves successful, it could help humans grow their own food in space, helping in the quest to colonise other planets. Called the Plant Gravity Sensing study, it will be conducted when new supplies are taken to the ISS by a SpaceX Dragon capsule on 13 April. The experiment will examine the cellular process of formation in thale cress, a small flowering plant related to cabbage. Small dishes will hold seedlings, and astronauts on the station will watch how they are able to grow inside the Japanese Kibo module. Scientists will be examining whether a plant’s ability to work out which way it is growing - the gravity sensor - can form in the absence of gravity. It should be noted that there is still gravity on the ISS but, owing to its orbit around Earth, things on the station are in a constant state of free-fall, simulating a zero-gravity environment. In the Kibo module, the plants will be placed in both the micro gravity ISS environment and in a small centrifuge, that can simulate Earth’s gravity. Results will show if the plants can sense changes in gravity, and adapt levels of calcium in their cells to compensate for it. The results could help farmers on Earth get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond Earth orbit to the moon and Mars (illustration shown) In particular, scientists think particles in plant cells that store and process starch for energy - amyloplast - may form in the direction of gravitational pull. By increasing calcium concentrations, the amyloplast can help the plant grow in a certain direction. Without gravity, though, scientists will be keen to see whether the same components can still assemble to make the plant grow in a certain direction. If the role of amyloplast is proven to be correct, it could mean that plants on Earth could be modified to make them more healthy. And it could also help cultivate healthy plants for consumption on future deep space missions, or even other planets. These culture dishes hold seedlings and the growing medium for the Plant Gravity Sensing investigation, which were used during astronaut training at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Tsukuba Space Center in March 2014 . The gravity sensor of the plant could be regulated to account for the different gravity on another planet - such as Mars, where it is a third of Earth’s. ‘We may design plants that respond to gravity vector changes more efficiently than wild ones,’ said Dr Hitoshi Tatsumi from the Nagoya University in Japan, who is running the experiment. ‘These plants will recover from collapse by winds or flood more rapidly than wild ones. Thus, the agricultural output of the designed plants will be greatly increased, which may solve, in part, the shortage of crops in the near future.’\n",

      "Greece has demanded more than £200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. The government yesterday unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich. The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or £204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month . The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’. Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler’s forces in 1941. More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone. Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim. It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures. The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany's GDP. Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. He has called the reparations question a ‘moral and ethical’ issue for his country. The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. ‘According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,’ he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece's debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece's state general accounting office. Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation – a fraction of the Greek demand. Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’ Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim . Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified. Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders. Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes. A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims. Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros. ‘After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,’ Mr Tsipras said. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty. He has claimed Europe dealt with his country's bankruptcy by ‘loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer’.\n",

      "(CNN)It's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in Panama: A historic handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new \"outstretched hand\" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book \"Open Veins of Latin America,\" which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to \"democratically elected\" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.\n",
